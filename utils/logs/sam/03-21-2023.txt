(Sam):

	FRONTEND:

		- react project setup: got rid of default App.js page
			and started from scratch
	
		- pages and components folders made for different types of react components

		- all main page components created as placeholders

		- navbar built with links to their corresponding pages

		- in App.js: pages routed to their corresponding URLs

	GIT:

		- spent time figuring out how to work with branches, merging, pushing, etc.
